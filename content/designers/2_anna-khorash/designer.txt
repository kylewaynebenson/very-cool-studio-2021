Bio:

Anna, a Contrast Foundry type designer and Hebrew expert, draws inspiration from crafting italics and scaling heights in rock climbing. With a masterâ€™s degree in type and typography from Moscow University of Printing Arts, she discovered her passion for type design. Her journey led her from refining her skills at Contrast Foundry to delving into the intricacies of Hebrew typefaces in Israel.
Fuelled by a thirst for knowledge and a love for letter-drawing, Anna furthered her studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. Today, as a freelance professional, she roams between the Netherlands, the US, and Israel, sharing her fervor for diverse scripts, printing techniques, and the art of stone carving.
