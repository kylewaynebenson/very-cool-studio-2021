Text: <p>Gosh is a soft, square sans. It feels like you swear you've seen it before. Inspired by Microgramma or Eurostile when printed and tightly spaced. Everything about Gosh is boxy, but nothing about it is sharp.</p><p>It's called Gosh, because, sheesh, there’s somethin’ so darn obvious about it.</p>

  sample: >
    In October I flew business class for the
    first time. In the chair next to me was
    a crusty old man who readily introduced
    himself as a tenured Math department
    chair (and professor of Probability and
    Statistics, he told me later) at Utah
    Valley University. I wasn’t in a
    chatty mood, but he didn’t seem to
    notice. After some silence he pointed at
    my journal and pen and commented “very
    trad”.
