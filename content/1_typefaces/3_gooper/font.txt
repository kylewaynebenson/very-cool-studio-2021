Text: <p>Gooper is a lively, loveable, sticky typeface made for the use of squishy living things, so they can communicate with other squishy living things. So go ahead and switch out whatever heartless minimalist font you were using for this bouncy sticky palâ€” and glippity, gloppity, goop! Your text is ALIVE!</p><p>Gooper is currently in production, and is available for sale in progress on <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/very-cool-studio/gooper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Future Fonts</a>.</p>

    You could tell by the way they sat on
    their hands, wiggling side to side,
    suppressing withered grins, the apostles
    were saving something special for the
    finish. As we neared the final hour of
    the weekend long event, there was little
    question this would be a conference to
    remember. In corridors during
    intermissions, attendees buzzed with
    rumors. There was much excitement about
    the idea of a change in commandments.
    They had experienced some minor and
    major policy change in the last decade
    (a little bit more rights for these
    folks, a bit fewer rights for those
    folks), and now the saints were ripe for
    something much bigger. In wards and
    meeting halls in the six months since
    the preceding conference, much had been
    speculated on. The lesser laws got a lot
    of talk. Maybe the saints would be
    allowed to drink coffee?
