  sample: >
    My memory is blurry after the video. I
    know I signed a few small bits of
    paperwork then Jon collected a few of
    his things. He followed me out of the
    office, through the park, and with me
    onto the northbound train. He purchased
    a few cans of beans and meat at the
    corner store a block from my place and
    made us a spicy soup with salted ham for
    dinner. He made breakfast, lunch, and
    dinner for us both and slept on the
    floor near my bed. Over two weeks we
    hardly spoke. His attention seemed
    elsewhere, in a book or following a new
    bird song. I remember his snortingâ€”he
    had some sinus infection, or perhaps
    chronic phlegm.
