Text: <p>An anfractuous venture of Very Cool Studios, Bruphy is the result of taking humankind’s oldest and most unfeigned question and asking it again: “can a Robert Simmons Sapphire Short Handle Flat Brush write 20th century latin letters worthy of MakeOTF?” While philosophers and literary critics have long suffered over the physical limitations of this question, only one (1) person has braved the path of experimentation. Like Marie Curie, who imposed her experiments upon herself, this death-or-glory typographer (me) walked the untrod path (make font) and crafted the antidote to generations of hankering. In Bruphy, today this riddle is solved, this question answered.</p>

  sample: >
    In the opening interior shot of the
    series, the south-side Smiths sit
    sprawled and stuffed on the couch and
    floor of their farmhouse-chic living
    room. Rawlings sits alone in the frame
    as the camera pans out slowly to reveal
    Coby, Carter, younger brother Clark, and
    sisters Charla, Carly, and Jessica. Coby
    sits shorter than the group, but each
    child younger stays about the same size.
    Even the baby Jessica, seven years old,
    sprawled out on the floor, leaning
    against Carter’s leg, looks twice her
    age. The only childish tell is visible
    in their varying abilities to stay
    still, decent on camera. They are a pile
    of puppies.
