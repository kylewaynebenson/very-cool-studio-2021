Text: <p>With an X-Acto blade, a basic memory of Helvetica Condensed, half a Letraset sheet for Avant Garde Medium Condensed, and 15 minutes, you might create Nudge. That's not how I designed Nudge, but it might be how you would. It’s based on a dog defecation sign composed of hand cut vinyl letters which I saw at Silver Lake Reservoir in LA. The letters on the sign stood out for having uncharacteristically narrow n’s, and nearly closed apertures. Nudge is in that vein. The contrast is low, the tapers are hardly visible. The rules feel a little broken, I’m not keeping track of which.</p>

    It’s April 1984, your first day
    working at the copy shop on 76th Street.
    This real 2nd person talkin’ ass named
    D.J. Mel is demanding a 90 minute turn
    around on 3500 B/W fliers for “D.J.
    Mel’s uptown disco gig” happening
    tonight. No sweat. You fire up the Xerox
    2400, feed in his messy paste-up
    and—pop, clang, beep, error. Ugh, MC
    Jammer! With an X-Acto blade, a basic
    memory of Helvetica, 15 minutes, half a
    Letraset sheet for Avant Garde Medium
    Condensed, you Nudge.
