One worthy of Florian Hardwig's brave font ID-ing in the comment section of Fonts in Use. Fifty-two letters should give you plenty of unique DNA to work with for identification, but it turns out the difference here comes down to the leg of the R and the skeleton of the K. Which says a lot about the Condensed Sans landscape. In the wider, more traditional-width fonts there's a lot you can do to differentiate by varying letter spacing or proportions, but where straightforward condensed gothics or grotesques go, most designs look similar.<\/p>"},"id":"98809452-2df3-438b-a7e3-5209872ccfb2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
