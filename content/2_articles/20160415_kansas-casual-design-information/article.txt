To appeal to their teenage demographic, I wanted to find something that felt youthful in that same way but just a little more contemporary. Those grungy hand written fonts came off just as friendly and inviting as they did outdated.

Most sign painter's casual style fonts have rounded corners to simulate the appearance of paint. That 2013 first draft had similar rounding, not for any reason in particular other than to mimic what I'd seen in existing type. Once I started painting more, I was surprised to find that paint, properly thinned, with each letter at about 2\" heights, rarely gave a rounded corner. I did find the rounded corner using my 1\" brush, with tempera instead of oil, but more often than not I found many sign painter's work was sharp and had pointed ends<a href=\"#rounded-corners\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b2<\/a>.

Footnotes: [{"content":{"text":"1. <a name=\"sign-painter-fonts\">At<\/a> that time there were very few painted fonts on the market. If I were to make a shortlist of good options now it would also include [Cortado](http:\/\/cortadoscript.com\/) and [Ahkio](http:\/\/mikamelvas.fi\/portfolio\/ahkio\/).\n2. <a name=\"rounded-corners\">I<\/a> wasn't aiming to create an authentic representation of the sign painter's single stroke. The one stroke style is only 50-60 years old\u2014which feels like such a narrow window for considering what is basic or average or authentic to an already less regimented genre. No sense in following loosely perceived conventions when they don't make sense for your personal style or experience. This video of [John Downer](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/96148455) has some great stuff on Single Strokes.\n3. <a name=\"changes\">Study<\/a> and time spent painting have made me rethink some of the stylistic decisions that I once felt were objective. I now see that it fits in a kind of mid ground between a gothic and a one-stroke: too tall and straight stemmed to pass as a one-stroke, too loose and italic to pass as a gothic. If I were to completely revisit it, I'd probably make changes to the proportions of some of the rounds, and draw a few variable alternates to make things feel a little more organic."},"id":"2b1b307e-f19b-44eb-9362-8cc22e66d8de","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
