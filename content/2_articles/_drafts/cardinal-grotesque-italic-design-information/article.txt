Title: Cardinal Grotesque Italic Design Information

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>There was a window of time when &lt;a href=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/fortfoundry.com\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/fortfoundry.com\/<\/a>\"&gt;Mattox Shuler&lt;\/a&gt; and I were exchanging frequent emails, using our combined brain power to bootcamp ourselves into overnight type designers. We both lacked a design background and were trepidatious about revealing ourselves as amateurs to the design universe. I remember one conversation we had about &lt;em&gt;True Italics&lt;\/em&gt; (LOL Meta!!!). Mattox had stumbled upon &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marksimonson.com\/notebook\/view\/FakevsTrueItalics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.marksimonson.com\/notebook\/view\/FakevsTrueItalics<\/a>\"&gt;Fake vs. True Italics&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/em&gt; by Mark Simonson. We both loved the clear comparison, but desperately failed to understand  the mechanical process that happened between the slanted glyph and its &lt;em&gt;True&lt;\/em&gt; counterpart.<\/p><p>Those differences feel more obvious to me now. I have a couple tricks that work for me\u2014but they followed my ability to see good italic forms, which I learned while trying to draw correct italics for Cardinal Grotesque. What follows is my best effort to quickly explain something that took me nearly seven years to begin to see.<\/p><p>&lt;h5&gt;The Basics&lt;\/h5&gt; <\/p><p>There are a few ways you can look at italics. Many italics are created by taking an upright drawing of a letter and slanting it or shearing it. This style is often referred to as a slant&lt;a href=\"#slant\"&gt;\u00b9&lt;\/a&gt;. Very prominent type faces employ this style, some more gracefully than others. The following two visual examples are pulled from &lt;a href=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/frerejones.com\/blog\/conductors-dual-structures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/frerejones.com\/blog\/conductors-dual-structures<\/a>\"&gt;Marching and Waltzing: Conductor\u2019s Dual Structures by Helen Rosner&lt;\/a&gt;.<\/p><p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Univers-rom_ita-800.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Univers-rom_ita-800.jpg<\/a>\" alt=\"Univers Roman and Italic from Type Sign Symbol by Adrian Frutiger, 1980.\" class=\"size-full\" \/&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Univers Roman and Italic from \u201cType Sign Symbol\u201d by Adrian Frutiger, 1980.&lt;\/span&gt;<\/p><p>Another way to look at italics is by creating cursive letterforms to compliment the roman forms. This method, which sometimes requires an entirely different pen and may have reinvented letter skeletons that are not similar to the roman forms, is often referred to as a true italic&lt;a href=\"#true-italic\"&gt;\u00b2&lt;\/a&gt; or a cursive italic.<\/p><p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Kennerley-rom_ita-800.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Kennerley-rom_ita-800.jpg<\/a>\" alt=\"Kennerley Roman and Italic from The Alphabet by Frederic Goudy, 1922 (1989 reprint).\" class=\"size-full\" \/&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Kennerley Roman and Italic from \u201cThe Alphabet\u201d by Frederic Goudy, 1922 (1989 reprint).&lt;\/span&gt;<\/p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Drawing&lt;\/h2&gt;<\/p><p>When I went about drawing the italics for Cardinal Grotesque I followed a hybrid of those two ideas by slanting the roman drawings and then optically correcting and adjusting them (similar to the method Mark Simonson described).<\/p><p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/1801\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/1801<\/a><em>SlantExample.png\" alt=\"1801<\/em>SlantExample\" width=\"1400\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-496\" \/&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;Thomas Jockin once said that italics looked best half slanted and half rotated.&lt;\/a&gt;<\/p><p>&lt;h5&gt;Diagonals&lt;\/h5&gt;<\/p><p>A great place to start pointing out differences is in a slanted diagonal character like an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;\/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;V&lt;\/code&gt;. If character has sides that are identical in weight when upright, it's easy enough to do a perpendicular measure of the two sides after slanting them to see that the left side now has a weight bias. That bias pushes weight from the top\/left and bottom\/right and pushes it into the top\/right and bottom\/left across the entire alphabet.<\/p><p>I extended my corner hooks as far as they could go while working on italics. If I don't, the slant will make the taper of diagonal forms look uncomfortable.<\/p><p>&lt;h5&gt;Rounds&lt;\/h5&gt;<\/p><p>The next place to look for misplacement is in the rounds. The round characters proved to be the most difficult, but once I had them figured out, things just started to fall into place on their own. One of the tricks I used was to re-align the on-curve-points at the top and bottom, and then align the side on-curve-points along an imagined perpendicular line. This is a trick easier shown than explained.<\/p><p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/1801\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/1801<\/a><em>SlantDemo.png\" alt=\"1801<\/em>SlantDemo\" class=\"size-full\" \/&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;First draft adjustments using the alignment method.&lt;\/span&gt;<\/p><p>The terminals of characters like &lt;code&gt;S&lt;\/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;G&lt;\/code&gt;, etc, often looked gutless and required a little intensifying to keep the same character that was there in the upright\/romans.<\/p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Production&lt;\/h2&gt;<\/p><p>To avoid character collision when italics interrupt uprights in a line of type, at the end of the drawing process I bulk shifted the characters backwards along the x-axis until the fit in their boxes more symmetrically. <\/p><p>The postscript name string must be no longer than 63 characters and restricted to the printable ASCII subset. This can become a problem with instances like like Cardinal Grotesque SemiCondensed ExtraBold Italic. This problem can be side stepped by giving your instances abbreviated names like &lt;code&gt;CardGrotSC EbIt&lt;\/code&gt;, and then setting &lt;code&gt;Preferred Family Name&lt;\/code&gt; to the full name &lt;code&gt;Cardinal Grotesque SemiCondensed&lt;\/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Preferred SubFamily Name&lt;\/code&gt; to the full name &lt;code&gt;ExtraBold Italic&lt;\/code&gt;.<\/p><p>&lt;img src=\"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-1.57.10-AM.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https:\/\/www.verycoolstudio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-07-25-at-1.57.10-AM.png<\/a>\" alt=\"Glyphs instance screenshot for Cardinal Grotesque Italic\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-542\" \/&gt;&lt;span class=\"caption\"&gt;If you're using Glyphs, that kind of &lt;code&gt;NAME&lt;\/code&gt; table modification will look like this.&lt;\/span&gt;<\/p><p>&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h2&gt;<\/p><p>While I still consider this to be in the far corner of type design taste priorities, I hope you can walk away from this read having learned even just a little more about the inclined half of the type world. If you're making your first jump into italics for a font family you're working on, keep in mind that from beginning to end redrawing the eighteen masters that create Cardinal Grotesque took, on and off, about eight months. I would make sure your font family needs an italic before doubling your workload.<\/p><p><\/p>"},"id":"6c43f4a5-0ce1-4130-a205-3dd2e4c3e92b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

Footnotes: [{"content":{"text":"1. <a name=\"slant\">Some<\/a> of my early releases were drawn that way. It's the quickest solution, and many slanting tools within Glyphs or RMX tools make subtle adjustments to make the slant appear more natural. A pretty hefty chunk of the fonts that get distributed through MyFonts have slanted italics. Even very popular and well known fonts like Museo Sans, some of the weights of Neue Helvetica, and Sofia Pro follow this model.\n2. <a name=\"true-italic\">This<\/a> meant using a different type of pen or pen angle, more narrow letter proportions, and sometimes entirely different letter skeletons. Embury Text, and FF Seria are good examples of this approach."},"id":"27946601-bebb-40ad-84dc-405a442fea7b","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
