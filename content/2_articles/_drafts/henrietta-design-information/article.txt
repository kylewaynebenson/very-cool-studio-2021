Title: Henrietta Design Information

Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I don\u2019t understand the disconnect between creators of fonts and users of fonts. I know these people (designers, writers, whatever), but I can\u2019t crack into their consciousnesses. I can\u2019t see why they don\u2019t see what I see. So, friends, co-workers, clients, family (bless their stupid heads) regularly send me examples of Cooper as Gooper-in-use.&nbsp;<\/p><p>It\u2019s a confusing interaction. Not because they\u2019re wrong, and wrongness is confusing, but because I\u2019m corned into correcting them, and correcting someone is confusing. I must explain something that I can hardly make sense of: my font is less cool than you thought, your eyes are less keen than you thought, and lots of fonts look very very very similar to the average person. <\/p><p>\u201cNo totally, looks just like it. And, well, Gooper is based on Cooper,\u201d I\u2019ll say. <\/p><p>And in another two weeks, my cousin, who I see twice a year, again calls my children by the wrong names.<\/p><p>ID-ing fonts has never helped my social capital. Normies don\u2019t like it, designers borderline hate when other designers do it. Well, all designers except for Matt Yow. Matt is about as good at it as they come, both in terms of when to pull out the parlor trick, and in the actual skill of ID-ing. He knows when to hold em, fold em, etc. So, when he tweeted out for an ID in October, 2021, he knew he had a fun puzzle.<\/p><p>Seeing this tweet was my first real exposure to Henrietta. Having spent the last several years drawing exclusively soft serifs, I was overjoyed to be see something NEW. At a certain point, not being able to font ID is its own kink. I was all in. Sure, it\u2019s a Souvenir rip-off, but one with its own underlying logic. One with defined, smart, departures from the ubiquitous soft serif queen. It has a flatness that squares up the old style angling at the core of Cooper, a warble that feels more Art Nouveau than it does Souvenir\u2019s turn of the century Arts and Crafts, a taller x-height, broad-nib terminals, none of Souvenir\u2019s characteristic gaps in the bowls, less contrast, some of the unexpected diagonality of Windsor, and a tightness more suited for the photo era than any of its soft contemporaries. And still, some of it\u2019s design felt ill-informed: oddly stiff numerals, inconsistent contrast, pieced together diacritics and furniture ($, \u00f8, \u00e7), and several characters that look entirely mis-weighted.<\/p><p>Most rip-offs aren\u2019t this opinionated. The whole idea is to siphon off some sales from the <em>real<\/em> version, right? Let\u2019s say this is an Arial-Helvetica scenario\u2014at what point did the creator of Henrietta decide to take some major artistic liberties?<\/p><p>After I became aware of Henrietta, I did notice it in the back of my Solotype catalog, and 1990\u2019s Homage to the Alphabet: A Typeface Sourcebook. It\u2019s in the sources, but it isn\u2019t really in the world. Maybe it sucks, lacks some important detail that keeps Souvenir in the upper echelon of font sales. Or maybe the foundry who created it didn\u2019t have a great distribution network, had a bad marketing team.<\/p><p>It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around. From my little internet centric perspective, in capitalism, a bit of fully sell-able intellectual property doesn\u2019t just fall by the wayside, unclaimed by the monoliths of font reselling. It\u2019s counter to the nature of the thing. Hell, we\u2019re still fucking using Baskerville! It\u2019s been 300 god damn years!<\/p><p>So I start a revival of it. Not a good one. Mostly out of curiosity. I trace some parts in Illustrator, and then begin copy-pasting into Glyphs. I\u2019m not really looking for ways to fill time, but I can\u2019t help but get a closer look at the drawings. The finders keepers ethics of font revivaling feels icky\u2014so I try to just have fun with it and not think about what I\u2019ll do with the finished files.<\/p><p>A few weeks pass, I\u2019m taking it pretty slowly, but because the drawings...exist, progress comes easily. Emily walks in the room, sees large bezier letters on my monitor and sighs. \u201cYou know this isn\u2019t Gooper,\u201d I defend myself, \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t create this font. This is someone else\u2019s font.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>How do you explain a revival, that, to your partner looks exactly like the font you still haven\u2019t finished, when I can hardly make sense of it yourself. And, truly, how did it get to be this way? How am I combing through the couch cushions of the internet, trying to find some evidence of ownership for these drawings? Is this popcorn kernel from two weeks ago, or two years ago? Is Henrietta inspired by Morris Fuller Benton\u2019s 1914 design, or Ed Benguiat\u2019s 1967 redrawing? I\u2019d like to believe I can tell the difference, but time is a flat circle etc.<\/p><p>Why did this land on <em>my <\/em>lap. Someone should have protected this thing, made sure their name was printed next to it in Phil\u2019s Fonts. But, then again, what would that matter? Nobody knows the names of fonts, let alone the names of their authors. Maybe fonts are too niche to get proper protection, to get preservation. You don\u2019t have anything like the Marvin Gaye estate going around, protecting a legacy.&nbsp;<\/p><p>All the while, Hoefler\u2019s sale to Monotype keeps coming to mind. There\u2019s a question, in the back of some creator\u2019s minds: who will preserve my intellectual property after I die? And, for type designers: what is a font that it can be preserved? I\u2019m not certain I\u2019d trust a judge to honorably get in the details here. Maybe it is held by the public though. If they can\u2019t distinguish the difference, does it justify its existence. I find myself feeling like the most solid signifier is in the public\u2019s ability to identify a font\u2014maybe even to name it.<\/p><p>Weeks later, we\u2019re watching The Shining with some friends. Amanda motions to the opening titles, set in Helvetica, \u201cwhat do you think of this font,\u201d she comments, \u201cseems modern. Seems out of place, for the 70s.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>And this is one of the many funny situations we get ourselves into with fonts. Souvenir came out in 1914, but its hey-day came in the 1970s&nbsp; (and, recently, the late 2010s), when Ed Benguiat licensed and re-drew it for Photo-Lettering.<\/p><p>I\u2019m knock-out drunk at a party, distributing glasses of milk, and telling everyone it\u2019s the latest aperitif.<\/p>"},"id":"29c15581-59a9-4ad2-ae3e-80596c7e5fbb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
