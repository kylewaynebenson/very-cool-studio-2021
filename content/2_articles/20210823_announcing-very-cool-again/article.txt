Title: Announcing Very Cool, Again

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>I launched verycoolstudio.com five years ago, and have spent countless hours regretting just about every decision I made in engineering it. The pageload times were awful, it was difficult to update or add new fonts to, and the two of us fought like eagle gripping snake right up until I decided to drop it from several hundred feet in the air and eat a small bunny instead. I wish I was the snake in that metaphor but honestly I can\u2019t figure out how the snake \u201cwins\u201d without it also losing.<\/p><p>When I started developing the site, oh, say, 2015, I was woefully out of touch with modern development, and Wordpress felt like the obvious choice. To me, it was the easiest, cheapest, option for an e-commerce site. The truth is, and probably was, that Wordpress is on its last leg, and the rest of the web is on version 5.0 (I think). So, the Wordpress plugins I used to assemble my little site have been getting less and less support from developers, and hackers have been catching up, and I\u2019ve been just like sitting on the sidelines crying or something. IDK, I can\u2019t keep up with all these web technologies. Long story short, I\u2019ve been dealing with exploits that I don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t fix left and right.<\/p><p>There\u2019s hardly a friend of mine who hasn\u2019t texted to let me know that my site is again flashing banner ads.<\/p><p>A decade ago you could hardly host a font on your website, let alone make a good online store. But a lot has changed in the last decade. Content management systems are better, faster, easier. Website builders abound. And loads of great people are making a living creating bespoke font e-commerce platforms. And so, In the summer of 2019, tired of responding to support emails, I started looking into having my site engineered by somebody other than little old me. I started a few conversations but ultimately I didn\u2019t follow through on any of them! This is a known bug. Please don\u2019t send a support email about it.<\/p><p>If I\u2019m sitting down and reviewing this with my therapist: I think I was scared to goof again. Sure, my website was giving me hell, but devil you know and all that. If I goofed once, couldn\u2019t I goof again? And maybe harder, this time?<\/p><p>So the Figma files for Very Cool V2 sat and gathered dust, and the site continued to be a mess.<\/p><p>After the launch of&nbsp;Nudge, verycoolstudios.com got exploited again. I think via my contact form? IDK, php is confusing to me. It was embarrassing. I was pointing all these cool people to my website, where I\u2019d written this nice article about the design process, and instead they were seeing bullshit and porn (and not in a cool way!). I needed a new website NOW, and the shame story I was telling myself about making exploitable websites wasn\u2019t helping anyone!<\/p><p>One of my favorite artists, Lomelda, said something somewhere about how she\u2019s always re-writing her songs. I think it was a reddit AMA. Someone was like \u201cdoes this song reference that song\u201d, and she was like \u201cthat song is that song. I just rewrote it.\u201d<\/p><p>I love this kind of stuff. Here\u2019s a similar Sally Rooney quote, from the City Arts &amp; Lectures series here in SF:<\/p>"},"id":"fa3d0b61-5cab-4cb4-94ae-1cdc18aba936","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"\u201c...artists in any genre, have basically the same themes and concerns forever\u2026And the technique always has to be different, because otherwise you\u2019d literally just be writing the same novel again and again...\u201d","citation":"Sally Rooney"},"id":"ba17a0a0-6695-489b-8237-b6d194312be8","isHidden":false,"type":"quote"},{"content":{"text":"<p>I love it. I love these kind of quotes that point out how cyclical and confusing creation can be. And I love how Sally Rooney talks about concerns and themes almost as synonyms. George Saunders believes a similar thing. Paraphrasing here, again, but George Saunders thinks we don't ever really grow out of our weakness, we just learn how to direct our weaknesses to the betterment of other people. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8000\/articles\/gooper-design-information#wikipedia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b9<\/a><\/p><p>Somewhere in the middle of this month, I watched the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hbo.com\/documentaries\/the-bee-gees-how-can-you-mend-a-broken-heart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart<\/a> and a bolt of lightning ran up my spine.<\/p><p>I mean, you should watch the doc. But if you can\u2019t, because you\u2019re like scared of bees or big hair or whatever, here\u2019s my summary: the Bee Gees never stopped changing their technique. The concerns and themes were the same, but the technique was always changing. One bad website doesn\u2019t make a bad website maker. If the Bee Gees could keep changing, so can I.<\/p><p>As a musician, I\u2019m embarrassed to say that when the film ended I picked up my macbook over my guitar. But that\u2019s how it happened! And I think we\u2019re all better for it.<\/p><p>I burned some midnight oil to make this new website<a href=\"#website\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b2<\/a>. Honestly, I'm like a B+ developer and never dreamed I could make something this good. I'm so fucking proud of myself! Hope you enjoy it too!<\/p>"},"id":"4e771d77-882f-4345-a10b-d0db4912faa6","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

Footnotes: [{"content":{"text":"1. <a name=\"saunders\">You<\/a> really should stop reading this and go read this book A Swim In A Pond In The Rain. It\u2019s a great craft book, but really just a good book on how to be a human being.\n2. <a name=\"website\">All<\/a> in all this thing probably took ~50 hours\u2014astonishing, considering my skillset. Web tools are just better! People are making cool shit. I spent another ~30 hours creating a [new license](\/terms), cleaning up Kansas Casual, setting up Shopify, and copying and pasting the content into my new CMS (Kirby! Kirby is lovely)."},"id":"3b729aba-78b7-401e-92e9-2c4079c1c257","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
