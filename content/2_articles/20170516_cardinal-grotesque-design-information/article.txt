Title: Cardinal Grotesque Design Information

----

Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>When I was in college, I worked as a layout designer for the school newspaper. I was then and am still now impressed with how many tasks are put on the shoulders of a single compressed font in news design. It must fit into a tight space, be readable, convey a huge variety of emotions from urgency to devastation to compassion all while gaining the interest of a reader and maintaining the brand of the newspaper.<\/p><p>Many of the great titling typefaces are grotesques, like: <a href=\"https:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/typefaces\/23\/fb-titling-gothic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">FB Titling Gothic<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/typefaces\/32\/bureau-grot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Bureau Grot<\/a>. Which is pretty cool, considering the style's history. Grotesques, the original sans serif <a href=\"#grotesques\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b9<\/a>, got their funny name because the public found them ugly. Their designs were far outside the expectations of how a letter should. It's a bit hard to comprehend, given the contemporary view on sans-serifs as the default choice of companies everywhere, from prudent tech companies to big ol' newspapers.<\/p>"},"id":"20bcabe2-46fd-4976-85d0-0e85726bae44","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["screen-shot-2017-04-05-at-5-08-26-pm.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Example of <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/founders-grotesk\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Bureau Grot Compressed Bold<\/a> by Font Bureau","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"d3ec8d5f-c6a7-4bf2-877f-5cb029a6c644","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>A few of the in-house companies I've worked for used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typography.com\/fonts\/tungsten\/overview\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Tungsten<\/a> for headlines.

My goal with Cardinal has been a similar one: to stop myself from sanding the design down before I've left it sanitized and neutral looking. I wanted to design a sans that felt casual. <\/p><p>Here are a few of the questions I was asking myself from the outset:<\/p>"},"id":"08e9816b-fb7c-4795-a6c0-553edc43fc03","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>Are we at peak recognizability with sans-serifs? <\/li><li>Have they found themselves in such common use, that any subtle variation will appear to be eccentric and exciting in the landscape of monolinear geometrics? see also: <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/NsS5uR-MOa8?t=3m1s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">James Edmondson's recent talk on this<\/a>.<\/li><li>How are modern tools preventing me from creative solutions to problems?

That feedback was something like, \u201dThis looks like another <a href=\"http:\/\/atftype.com\/atf-alternate-gothic.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">ATF titling<\/a> rip off. Does the world really need another one of those?\u201d The question, \u201cdo we need another new font,\u201d is not new, but the question, \u201cdo we need another condensed font,\u201d made me wonder: can all the problems in one small part of type design be solved? Once they're solved, has the style by that point become too boring to be revisited? <\/p><p>Yes, we need new fonts, but are we sure we need new condensed neo-grotesques?<\/p><p>Careful beta-testing <a href=\"#beta-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b2<\/a> was the process that helped me answer that question. About a year before releasing it I sent it to many designers, and received a good deal of feedback that I wasn't expecting. At the time of that first beta release, it only had 3 widths at 8 weights each (all condensed). Feedback from those using it insisted that a wider width, rather than italics, should be where I spend my time.<\/p>"},"id":"ede9a0f7-9e93-43a7-ba75-a3bcf55f6c85","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"Spacing"},"id":"c48e2c0b-2d76-4b74-af0e-9a5d1b19e6bc","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Fitting traditionally wide letters into a spaces one quarter or one eighth their standard size requires some problem solving and convention breaking. Each of the various letter trades solve this problem differently. With a condensed face, type designers will often cut away from the positive space of letters like M and W in order to fit every condensed letter within a relatively common width. Painters, perhaps because of the physicality of their tools, will care less about width and allow the letter proportions to flex in order to maintained a relatively common stem width.<\/p>"},"id":"759e71d5-8851-4644-a22b-c1d81119b2d7","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["foundersgrotesque.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Example of <a href=\"https:\/\/klim.co.nz\/retail-fonts\/founders-grotesk\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Founder's Grotesque<\/a> by Kris Sowersby, which carves away positive space in order to maintain consistent feelings widths","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"6da4c880-5846-4b7b-8fdc-8deb152af3c3","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["t5617_06.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Specimen of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youworkforthem.com\/font\/T5617\/cinderblock\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Cinderblock<\/a> by Stefan Kjartansson, which maintains consistent positive space widths at the expense of consistent letter width","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"723f31c1-79ed-4a84-b444-2753b459f3c3","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["1-losgal.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Example of vernacular letterforms that have no consistent letter width, but maintain consistent feel and rhythm","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"40699792-1819-4f9d-bd0b-336cecad5af7","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["menudo.png"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Example of window painted letterforms that use a modular brush width to construct the letters.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"8eb250ca-d24b-4ef4-878f-18036a382a9f","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"level":"h4","text":"Interpolating"},"id":"9108a558-4a3a-409c-9645-558f904d067c","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The contemporary process for creating font weights is called interpolation. You draw a super bold weight, then you draw a super light weight, and then you ask the computer to do everything else.

The tools for building flexible fonts are getting better, but not quite at the necessary rate.

Only operating systems currently support automatic optical sizes, leaving the user to make the switch as needed. And variable fonts still miles away.<\/p><p>So rather than fuss about with it, I set all my proofs to a mid range, between 16pt and 40pt. This gives it just a little bit extra of flexibility but it mostly shines there and larger. I won't bullshit you and say it \u201dworks in display and text\u201d. It mostly works in Display and kinda works a little bit smaller.
