Title: Gooper Design Information

Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Gooper was drawn in adoration of goopy, swashy, fat faced, tight and touching old style serifs.

Where usually an ornamental decision like goopiness or roundness feels like a secondary feature, Cooper's goopiness creates a rhythm so consistent that it sets the pace in the same way stem thickness or curve tension can. It's so fixed that you might imagine Cooper was made with a specific writing tool. And there kind of is precedent for goopy letters made with goopy tools: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gVMoUcbDacU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">round nibs<\/a> (commonly used for smaller uppercase lettering on show cards), painted letters made with sub 1\/4\u201d single stroke quills, or even the mysterious universe of turn of the century goopy fat faces. These fat faces feel like the obvious inspiration and provide a less apocryphal explanation for Oswald's masterpiece.<\/p>"},"id":"27f42b6e-aa53-4ea7-a44e-d83782d6b893","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_2312.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"4c38eb6b-603d-4e79-9320-1bd3c6e73de7","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_2361.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"2ff64e16-d2cf-4215-af5e-d5cb449c0b76","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_3542.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"8f45bea6-7d90-4086-8c60-a044925035b9","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["img_2318.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"dacc9ee8-34a3-4ae8-a4ac-49642616ab1d","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>With the release of Fontstand, we the proletariat (I) finally had access to display type that we (I) had always wanted to try before buy.

While I'm still pretty unfamiliar with the universe<a href=\"#photo-type\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">\u00b2<\/a> of photo and dry transfer type, using and exploring the Plinc library helped me better understand their motives. Cooper Nouveau shared that rhythmic goopiness with Cooper, but little to nothing else. In stride with other type of that era, it banked on the popularity of the name and then added some swashes. Otherwise their contrast, width, weight balance, and even the amount of goopiness was entirely different.

My intention was not to create a competitor, or cheaper and slightly altered Cooper. Like most of you my taste is burdened by nostalgia, which means invariably the old and vernacular escape rationalization for why I love them. They weave into my work and become something undifferentiated from creations that are distinctly mine. If you think Gooper is neat, if you buy it and use it, or if you hate it\u2014I would love nothing more than that feedback.

Intro: This article was made in conjunction with Goopers's V.01 release on Future Fonts. A lot has changed about Gooper since publication.

Footnotes: [{"content":{"text":"<ol class=\"footnotes\">\n      <li id=\"wikipedia\">The important take away I have from reading that Wikipedia page: Cooper Black was advertised as being 'for far-sighted printers with near-sighted customers'.<\/li>\n\t<li id=\"photo-type\">Some resources I've found helpful for better understanding the advertising age's type tech: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Rx2ICnkFQDE\">Riley Cran's Typographics talk<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/foundry\/130\/photo-lettering\">Fonts in Use Photo-Lettering section<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/creativepro.com\/scanning-around-gene-when-letraset-was-king\/\">When Letraset was King<\/a> <\/li>\n<li id=\"struggle\">OHno Type Co's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.futurefonts.xyz\/ohno\/ohno-blazeface-italic\">Blazeface<\/a> uses words blaze and stoney filter, Type Supply's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.typesupply.com\/fonts\/marigny\">Marigny<\/a> uses the word warmth, and Sun Helen's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.futurefonts.xyz\/sunhelen\/ricochet\">Ricochet<\/a> uses words playful and bouncy.<\/li>\n<li id=\"remix-tools\">The primary reason for this approach is JAF's incredible <a href=\"https:\/\/remix-tools.com\/\">Remix Tools<\/a>. Being able to quickly\/crudely make adjustments to width\/weight via interpolation with Remix Tools as I flesh out letters has been a game changer for me. I don't think I can ever go back to drawing one master at a time.<\/li>"},"id":"2d1c7202-efa3-4ea6-a0f2-047502a59e6d","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}]
