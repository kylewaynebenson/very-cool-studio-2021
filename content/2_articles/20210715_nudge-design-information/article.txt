In the wider, more traditional-width fonts there's a lot you can do to differentiate by varying letter spacing or proportions, but where straightforward condensed gothics or grotesques go, most designs look similar.<\/p>"},"id":"98809452-2df3-438b-a7e3-5209872ccfb2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["twin-peaks-fonts-in-use.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Comment by Florian Hardwig on <a href=\"https:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/uses\/17063\/twin-peaks-opening-titles\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">the Twin Peaks titles post on Fonts In Use<\/a>.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"cb3cfd36-a2ef-4969-b51d-c17666a08797","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The Twin Peaks title font, ITC Avant Garde Gothic Condensed, is a distant cousin of the famous original width created by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnese. In contrast to the Lubalin\/Carnese version, it has youthful, superellipse-ive curves drawn by Ed Benguiat (among others). Prior to two months ago, I had forgotten it existed. And in this rediscovery, the lack of relationship between Lubalin\u2019s tight, interlocking, one-stop logo-maker, and the loosely spaced, not particularly condensed, and (perhaps most important) traditional letterforms seen in Twin Peak\u2019s titles stood out to me.<\/p>"},"id":"454be51f-0467-4739-9773-b0ebf7105518","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["image-12.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Avant Garde Gothic Condensed Promotion (<a href=\"https:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/uses\/15922\/hi-fi-news-andamp-record-review-march-1977#comment-647170\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">also a Florian Hardwig find<\/a>)","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"1e717a57-2621-498f-8c87-eda0e6e4c4f8","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In the marketing, the value is clear: Avant Garde Gothic Condensed has all the fun of Avant Garde, now with a little less wide. The design is now nearly fifty years old, but its use cases have rarely included those readily identifiable interlocking letters. In the year 2000, when ITC brought the family into digital they didn\u2019t even take the time to include those notorious ligatures in the Condensed styles.<\/p><p>I guess you could say I know a bit about Gothic Condensed fonts. I made one <em>myself<\/em> in 2014. And I released v0.1 of another on Future Fonts today.<\/p><p>Little surprise, that 2014 design was sign-painter inspired. I spent all summer and fall designing the letters then proofing them with squirrel hair brushes and One Shot in the drafty carport attached to my one bedroom apartment. I was so proud of it. I used it to apply for the Type@Cooper condensed program, which I attended in the summer of 2015. It took about a week in the program to realize I would never release it. In a flash, a year\u2019s worth of work transformed from living art to soulless cadaver. I don\u2019t know how exactly, but the program gave me the eye to see my work had all the necessary human-stuffs, but none of the human. In other words: plenty of tone but no voice.<\/p>"},"id":"3096cf0e-9caf-402d-ad85-4bd1dc4de5e8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["painters-grotesque.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Painters Grotesque, 2014, abandoned","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"aecaf0ed-7f44-4360-84d8-8cff93f20f17","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Let me explain what I mean here. \u201cVoice and tone?\u201d, you\u2019re probably screaming at your computer, \u201cI thought we were talking fonts!\u201d Well, yes. But, nothing is as message obscuring as type terminology. Maybe I\u2019m just not a technical writer, but I\u2019ve found those words have a way of reducing all the pleasant nuance down to a matter of taxonomy. When I can, I try not to use them. Instead, here, I\u2019ve opted for a voice\/tone framework. Tone is the way something is said, voice is the person saying it. It\u2019s a bit simplistic, but at the least it\u2019ll keep me from killing the mood with words like \u201cbezier\u201d or \u201csoulless cadaver\u201d.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s an example from my other favorite craft: music. When songwriters try to sound like Bob Dylan, as they so often do, everybody can tell. Not just other songwriters. First because Dylan isn\u2019t great at singing (as we learned with the Traveling Wilburys), and second because poetry isn't imitatible (as we learned with the Traveling Wilburys). The nearest thing to his magnetic idiosyncrasy is just doing a bad job. Everything closer after that dips lower and lower into that valley of uncanny human-stuffs cadavers. Many can mimic the Dylan tone, it's much harder to take on the Dylan voice.<\/p><p>But, choose to sound like Dylan or not, everything crafted gets a gloss coat of charming, imperfect humanity\u2014or, in other words: voice! And voice is difficult to hide, but impossible to fake. You can\u2019t fake poetry, and you can\u2019t take the humanity out of a letterform.<\/p><p>Which brings me back to my failed condensed gothic. At that time my phone\u2019s photo album was filled with bizarre ligatures or flourishes\u2014exceptions to what I understood as rule. These odd discoveries made type feel spacious enough for my inability. But the letterform variety show gets old fast. And, after my eyes got adjusted by Type@Cooper, I had the troublesome problem of seeing something lovable about all letter art\u2014not just the big tone, over-the-top, fun stuff.<\/p><p>Though you might not see it in my work, these days what catches my eye is a bit more modest. I\u2019m especially drawn to examples of a well-trodden genre with a small but convincing exception. Like, for example, the credits of Twin Peaks, where Benguiat\u2019s ITC Avant Garde Gothic Condensed\u2019s apertures stood out to me for being nearly closed. I\u2019ve grown to crave those evidences of a craftsman (Ed Benguiat, in this case) in a moment of deviance (always, in Ed Benguiat\u2019s case). In the case of ITC Avant Garde Gothic, it's those nearly accidental bits of voice which has survived (not the ligatures).<\/p>"},"id":"bd8f9d34-682f-4626-b4e2-d8f7cf9a1999","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["disco-fliers.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Hip Hop Flyers from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oldschoolflyers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">@OldSchoolFlyers<\/a>.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"e2bec506-e354-460d-b456-8a20c2d6993f","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>These deviances are easy to spot, but difficult to reproduce.

And it\u2019s lots of fun.<\/p><p>Tone proves that with enough effort anyone can make a name for themselves while creating some distance away from your competitor\u2019s more ubiquitous takes. But, in my experience, that's about all it'll do. That affection for tone (for, oh, say, hand painted signs) may help market your font, but it isn't gonna help when you're stuck on how to draw the leg of an R or skeleton of a K.<\/p><p>It\u2019s sticky business to find those voice questions when you\u2019re in tone territory. Unfortunately, tone never does have much of an opinion to assert. Tone may have made a song memorable, but it\u2019s voice that made it in the first place. And voice, craft, just takes time to see and understand. You can learn why that song you love is so good once you can write one of your own\u2014and by that point, you might love your own voice enough to not worry about it.<\/p>"},"id":"0470a390-ad64-4f59-b81e-42536044295f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["voice-deviance.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Examples of letter setting deviance, LTR: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FroyoTam\/status\/1404991553681051649?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">MacUser ad<\/a>, RV Park sign (from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/elisecarlton\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Elise Carlton<\/a>'s always fantastic Instagram), Auto Sign probably spotted somewhere in the American West, small crop from the type heavy work of Ram Dass.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"c229f692-00a6-4b07-8930-f20bababb192","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Okay, I'm rambling.<\/p><p>Let me try to sum it up. I\u2019ve grown less certain of my creative decision-making abilities in time.
