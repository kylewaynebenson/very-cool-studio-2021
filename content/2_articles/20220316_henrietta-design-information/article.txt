And then kind people are sending me more proof. Florian Hardwig sent some from Phil\u2019s Photo, 1980. Stephen Coles found the full alphabet, with alternates, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/stewf\/51914513318\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Rand Typography specimen<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/typographica\/status\/1453786846429777925?s=20&amp;t=ziAwpaBMzmFNC6v77D1zgw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Andresen Typographics<\/a>.<\/p><p>Henrietta was (probably) designed in the 1980s. It\u2019s (probably) a Souvenir rip-off, but a rip-off with its own underlying logic. Henrietta has defined departures from that ubiquitous soft serif queen and just about everything else in the genre. It has a flatness that keeps it from being an oldstyle, a warble that feels more Art Nouveau than it does Arts and Crafts, a tall x-height, thick terminals, low contrast, with a lot of the diagonality of Windsor in the lowercase. In every in-use I found, the letters are spaced tightly. It wasn\u2019t half-baked. Henrietta was a completed work. It\u2019s a type family that shot for the zeitgeist and apparently, missed. Which makes it all the more strange to find that big distributors clearly thought it would (probably) sell.<\/p><p>Henrietta is in many of the big sources, but it isn\u2019t really in the world.&nbsp;<\/p><p>But how? A morsel of sellable intellectual property doesn\u2019t just fall by the wayside. In capitalism, nothing goes unclaimed! And yet, in all these sources, there isn\u2019t a credit. No owner, no creator, no foundry, no manufacturer.<\/p>"},"id":"d8a7664d-537b-4270-85cd-4df2e4779c9a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["screen-shot-2022-03-16-at-12.08.03-am.png"],"src":"","alt":"A quick sample of goo","caption":"Rand Typography specimen","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"f794facc-22d2-4636-b714-5fc7aa46b19a","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Some rip-offs are famous, some are quietly noticed, most designs qualify as a rip-off in some respect. With fonts, what looks like a brazen attempt to recreate an existing work for commercial interests usually is one. The big rip-offs, the Arials to your Helvetica, the Inter to your San Francisco, aren\u2019t opinionated. With these works, any clear differentiation jeopardizes the rip-and-replace potential that makes the design appealing in the first place. Henrietta was trying for something. What stood out to me about it, made it worth reviving, is that it\u2019s an <em>opinionated<\/em> rip-off.<\/p><p>There are these rumors, in the type community, these hypothetical scenarios where a judge has to decide if a font\u2019s design has been infringed. Some say the code of the font is compared\u2014the numbers, the ones and zeros, are what gets scrutinized. It\u2019s a math equation. And, certainly, there\u2019s no math to be compared here. Henrietta hasn\u2019t been digitized before.&nbsp;<\/p><p>But there\u2019s those who say it\u2019s the drawings\u2014a pdf print out, a dozen \u201cquick brown fox jumps\u201d are passed between a blind ol\u2018 judge and a clueless jury. Justice is made by the layman\u2019s eye. In this setup, I\u2019m not sure where Henrietta stands.<\/p><p>Somewhere in all of this, it\u2019s October, I\u2019m redrawing Henrietta, my partner Emily and I have friends over to watch The Shining. Someone comments on the titles, speaking covertly to me, \u201cwhat do you think of this font?\u201d They say unknowingly of Helvetica, \u201cseems modern, out of place, for the 70s.\u201d<\/p><p>Around that time, while I was mindlessly smoothing out beziers and resizing corner components, the surface of the calm lake of my mind was sometimes disturbed by the image of my future self writing this post. Why am I doing this, I would wonder, as I noticed another bit of loogie crusted to the wall. How will I ever explain a revival that, to many, looks exactly like the several soft serif fonts I still haven\u2019t finished?<\/p><p>I certainly have my own opinions. I think Henrietta should be a workable digital font. I think it should exist in the world. And, I think I'm the guy to do it. I have a little practice in this territory. I asserted those opinions in the act of reviving it. What more can be said?<\/p>"},"id":"f850f455-1723-48af-8fbb-33e1d9c54661","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["screen-shot-2022-03-16-at-12.08.48-am.jpeg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"1990\u2019s Homage to the Alphabet: A Typeface Sourcebook","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"add381f8-3760-4327-9aae-1b2e6be9887e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>But there\u2019s something in this that feels insidious, something \u201cevery man for himself\u201d, about the whole thing. Something I wish I could explain.<\/p><p>Here I was, October 11th, at my desk in Oakland, minding my own, bemusing myself on the museum of culture (Twitter), when I discovered a rare bird feather from an extinct animal. So I take it, simply because there is no direct consequence and my intuition tells me to. The guards are asleep and the curators long ago forgot there even were birds in the museum. The buyers are stoked on the feathers and not all that interested in where they came from. Win, win, win, win, win!

Anyone on Instagram knows this.

Part of me thought the ethics of the thing would resolve when the release flopped. After all, Henrietta had one fruitless release to its name. I wondered if Henrietta lacked some important detail\u2014a detail that Souvenir had, which kept it in the upper echelon of font sales, made it worth reviving by the likes of Benguiat.<\/p><p>Or maybe, like Souvenir, the creators of Henrietta took a strange marketing approach.<\/p><p>Or maybe (probably) Henrietta was released during the Souvenir blowback of 1970-2010.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I don\u2019t believe we amount to much, as individuals, when it comes to the sum total of our unique contributions. This feels especially so with fonts. We can hardly understand how these symbols came to exist, let alone take credit for their tiny evolutions. I guess I\u2019d like to see Henrietta have a little bit of a moment. No sense in letting a good set of curves go to waste. Somebody put time into it. And then...I put a little time into it. Hopefully...you\u2019ll put some time into it. Together, with our unique contributions combined, we\u2019ve (probably) got a good shot at making something, at the least, <em>opinionated<\/em>.<\/p>"},"id":"1d9ef184-8b92-4d7d-a1b5-330c12c63cb5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
