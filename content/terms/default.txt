Title: Terms

----

Text:

This page includes the terms for those who purchase a license (the EULA), and the terms for those who are just downloading trials. Fonts are complicated enough without the ridiculous terms, so these are kept pretty simple, and written in plain language. Let's be good to each other and everything will be just fine. When in doubt, reach out. I want you to some cool fonts. Let's make that happen.
